Spec Builder is a React-based application that converts vague product ideas into formal, traceable, machine-usable software specifications.

The system works by:
	1.	Asking high-information clarifying questions
	2.	Recording all answers with version history
	3.	Compiling answers into a deterministic structured spec
	4.	Validating the spec for completeness and conflicts
	5.	Visualizing structure and dependencies
	6.	Exporting artifacts suitable for AI coding agents

It is explicitly not a chat app. It is a requirements compiler with a UI.
